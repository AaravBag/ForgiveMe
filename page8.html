        <p>I really appreciate your understanding and kindness. It means the world to me that youâ€™re willing to give things another chance. I promise to do my best to make sure I donâ€™t repeat my mistakes and to make things better between us.

            Your forgiveness gives me hope, and Iâ€™m truly grateful for that. ðŸ˜Š</p>
